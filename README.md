# OpticalCharacterRecognition

OCR systems used to be quite expensive and cumbersome to build a couple of decades ago. But advances in the computer vision and deep learning field mean we can build our own OCR system right now!


But building an OCR system isnâ€™t a straightforward task. For starters, it is filled with problems like different fonts in images, poor contrast, multiple objects in an image, etc.

So in this repository, I have discussed all these probelems in my notebooks along with code.
